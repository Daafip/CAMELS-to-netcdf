# CAMELS to netCDF

This repo takes the work by Newman et al: 

_Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N. and Clark, M. P.: The CAMELS data set: catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21(10), 5293â€“5313, doi:10.5194/hess-21-5293-2017 , 2017._ 

and converts the textfiles of the original data set found here https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels.html and converts this to netCDF.

The main purpose was to make them more accessible for eWaterCycle, using the [OpenDAP service](https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/djht/ca13056c-c347-4a27-b320-930c2a4dd207/1/catalog.html) from the data.4tu.nl, see [doi: 10.4121/ca13056c-c347-4a27-b320-930c2a4dd207.v1](https://doi.org/10.4121/ca13056c-c347-4a27-b320-930c2a4dd207.v1) for more info. 

The netCDF files are large, so not hosted here: but are accessible via the openDAP link provided. They might be also be added in an updated version of the data set by Newman et al.
